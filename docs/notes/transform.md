title: Transform

For formula:

R(x, y) = 0 => R(f(x), g(x)) = 0

(x, y) => (f(x), g(x)) is a transform of the coordinate.

- A transform of the coordinate, can be viewed as transform the grid of the coordinate.
- Transform of graph is the reverse of the transform of the coordinate.

For motion:

If R(x, y) = 0 is represented by

x = r(t)
y = s(t)

Then

x = f(r(t))
y = g(s(t))

is a transform of the graph itself.

Because viewed as R(x, y) it is
r^-1(x) = s^-1(y) => r^-1(f^-1(x)) = s^-1(g^-1(y))
